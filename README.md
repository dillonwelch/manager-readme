# Hi, I'm Dillon

If you're here, it's probably because I sent this to you in order to help you understand me. Or maybe you're just looking at my Github - hi! Either way, I hope this helps us build a better relationship together going forward.

## A little about me

I'm a gamer. I like to cook and bake. I like to read. I'm an introvert who prefers small groups - if I'm quiet don't think I'm not paying attention or ignoring you. I'm always looking out for how to optimize or make things better. I have two cats and love animals. I abuse memes, stupid jokes, and emojis.

## My working hours/remote working/PTO

I often don't sleep well for a variety of reasons, so I'm not really a morning person. I aim to get into the office between 9-10 AM. I'll usually stay until 5-6 PM, but will sometimes leave earlier for things like doctor's appointments. I will often work from home (WFH) later in the evening or on weekends to make up for appointments, because I was in "the flow", or just because I had an idea I want to hack on.  I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and can't sleep so I'll do some work then too. I don't expect any of this from anyone else. I will often do reading at night and send articles I find interesting. Feel free to ignore any messages I sent after-hours until the next business day.

Besides evening, I WFH/remote sometimes when I'm not feeling well (often), when I need to be home for something like apartment maintenance, when I need to have a "deep focus" day to dive into a problem, or when I'm traveling and can squeeze in some work instead of PTO (like on airplanes).

I am a firm believer in using PTO in general and also love to travel and use big blocks of PTO to do 1-2 week vacations. I occasionally also need to use big blocks for medical reasons. All of this will be communicated well in advance when possible.

## Your working hours

As long as you're available for others when needed and your work gets done, whatever works best for your needs. I expect around 40 hours a week. I do not expect weekend or evening work in general. If a situation calls for it, because who doesn't like working until 4 AM to meet a certification deadline, I will discuss with you in advance and work with you if it's not possible.

Similar to my approach, WFH/remote within reason and PTO as desired as long as it's communicated properly. Doctor appointments, picking up kids, assisting with family, medical issues, etc are all things that can be planned for if communicated.

## Meetings

Some meetings are necessary and sometimes I even seek out meetings - our 1:1 will be one of those. When possible, I like to minimize meetings and aim for e-mail/Slack/awkwardly-waiting-for-food-to-microwave-or-tea-to-steep chats to hash out problems. Don't be offended if I redirect a meeeting request in this fashion.

When going into a meeting, I like to know the agenda/goal so I can come prepared/determine if I even need to be there. I try to provide the same to others. I like to batch meetings together so that I don't have a patchwork of a calendar. I like to spike/hack on an idea over having endless meetings discussing it.

All this being said, if you do need to have a meeting I am happy to do so - just put something on my calendar during my working hours.

## 1-1s

I like to have these around once a week for 30 min. The frequency and length are up for discussion. These meetings are primarily for you to bring up anything you want: issues with peers, career goals, benefits questions, PTO planning, project ideas, feedback for me, etc. I will also use this time to provide feedback as I have it and any news/status updates based on previous talking points. I consider this part of the agenda secondary and will schedule another session if necessary.

I generally don't want this to be a status meeting - that should be covered by standup.

## Thoughts on programming/design philosophy

I'm very big on having a style guide and following it. I find this drastically reduces the cognitive load of switching between sections of code as it all has the same format.

I optimize code for cognitive complexity and performance/speed. There should be as few lines of code/modules/classes/etc. and they should be fast. This also applies to DevOps, where I lean towards using managed services to reduce the amount of servers and apps to maintain.

I'm a believer in the "broken window" theory of crime applying to bugs. I feel that the vast majority of bugs should not be allowed to fester in order to keep the cognitive complexity of assessing "is the application working?" low. In parallel, I believe the user should never see an application error screen if we can help it. Put a third way, every error that pops up in our monitoring tool should be something we plan to addreess in some fashion.

I'm a believer in fixing "small things" and leaving the world a better place than you found it. Ten dimes and a dollar bill have the same value.

I like to focus on building what is needed to solve the problem as it's understood today instead of overbuilding for a problem that may or may not occur tomorrow. Get the fix/feature/etc in front of customers, measure, and iterate.

I am obsessive about being on the latest version of libraries.

I am to be as close as possible to 100% test coverage.

## What I aim to do for you

* Ensure you are satisfied with your role at the company, and work with you if you're not
* Set context around your work and how it relates to company goals
* Be there for you as a thought partner on your projects
* Provide feedback in a timely manner as I have it

If I'm not providing any of the above, let me know.

## Some of my quirks

* Sometimes I blank out on responding to messages - bug me if I forget
* Sometimes I can babble/way over-explain - stop me!
* Sometimes I get fidget-y
* I like to have something in my hands to play with

## Things that annoy me/trigger me/etc

* Being talked over
* Time not being respected
  * Meetings going over time
  * Starting meetings late
  * "This has to be done now" followed by not using the thing for days/weeks/ever
  * Being asked to build a product that flops because customer needs weren't understood
* Apathy, especially when I'm putting in effort to address your needs
* Intentionally ignored bugs/warnings/etc that are fixable
